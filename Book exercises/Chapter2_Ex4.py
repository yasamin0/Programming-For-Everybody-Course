# Assume that we execute the following assignment statement:
width = 17
height = 12.0

# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type ( of the value of the expression.)

# 1. width//2

print(width//2)
print(type(width//2))

# 2. width/2.0

print(width/2.0)
print(type(width/2.0))

#3. height/3

print(height/3)
print(type(height/3))

#4. 1 + 2 * 5

print(1 + 2 * 5)
print(type(1 + 2 * 5))
